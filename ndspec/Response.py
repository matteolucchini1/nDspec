class ResponseMatrix(nDspecOperator):
    """
    This class handles folding an energy-dependent, multi-dimensional product,
    through a given X-ray instrument response matrix, including the effects of
    both the redistribution matrix and the effective area. 

    Currently the X-ray observatories explicitely supported are NICER, NuSTAR 
    and RXTE. Swift/XRT/XMM/Chandra/Insight-HXMT/Astrosat should be compatible 
    but have not yet been tested. Support for these missions is pending. 
    
    XRISM and Athena are NOT compatible with this code due to a) the large size 
    of their responses and b) the unusual format of the contents of the 
    responses when read with Astropy. Fixes for both of these issues are 
    pending.     
    
    Parameters: 
    -----------  
    resp_path: string 
        The path to the response file (either .rmf or .rsp) to load.
    
    Other parameters:
    -----------------  
    arf_path: string 
        Optional path to an effective area file (.arf) to load along with the 
        redistribution matrix.  Note that some mission tools produce .rmf files 
        which also contain the telescope effective area, in which case loading 
        the arf is not necessary. 
        
    Attributes:
    -----------
    chans: numpy.array(int)
        An array of integers of size (n_chans) representing each channel in the 
        response.
        
    n_chans: int
        The length of the chans array.
    
    emin, emax: numpy.array(float)
        The arrays with the minimum/maximum energies in each channel in the  
        chans array. After rebinning on a new grid, it contains the minimum and  
        maximum energies of each bin in the new grid.
        
    energ_lo, energ_hi: numpy.array(float)
        The arrays with the minimum/maximum energies bins that sample the 
        instrument rmf/arf.
        
    n_energs: int
        The length of the energ_lo/energ_hi arrays.
        
    resp_matrix: numpy.array(float x float)
        The instrument response in matrix form, with size (n_energs x n_chans). 
        Only contains the redistribution matrix if no arf is loaded yet.

    specresp: numpy.array(float)
        The instrument effective area as a function of energy as contained in 
        the arf file.
        
    energ_rebin: bool
        A flag to check whether the response was re-binned over energies, in 
        which case folding requires a renormalization constant to conserve the
        total photon counts  
        
    has_arf: bool
        A flag to check whether only a rmf file has been loaded, or a full 
        rmf+arf response. This varies between observatories.  
        
    mission: str 
        A string which tracks the observatory for which the response is defined. 
        
    instrument: str 
        A string which tracks the instrument for which the response is defined.

        Parameters:
        -----------      
        model_input: np.array(float,float) or CrossSpectrum
            Either a) a 2-d array of size (n_energs x arbirtrary length), 
            containing the input model as a function of energy and optionally an 
            additional quantity (Fourier frequency, time, pulse phase, etc.), 
            or b) a CrossSpectrum object from nDspec, containing the model cross
            spectrum to be folded with the instrument response.
            
        units_in: string, default="rate"
            A string detailing the normalization of the iinput model. The base 
            "xspec" normalization assumes the input is in units of count rate
            times energy bin width in each bin; "rate" normalization assumes the
            input is in units of count rate in each bin. 
            
        units_out: string, default="kev"
            A string setting the normalization of the output model. The default 
            "kev" normalizations returns a model in units of counts/s/kev, 
            "channel" instead returns a model in units of counts/s/channel.
        
        Returns:
        -------- 
        conv_model, np.array(float,float) or CrossSpectrum
            Either a) a 2-d array of size (n_chans x arbitrary length), 
            containing the input model as a function of energy channel and a 
            secondary quantity identical to the input model_input (Fourier 
            frequency, time, pulse phase, etc.), or a CrossSpectrum object from
            nDspec, containing the folded model cross spectrum as a function of
            energy channel and Fourier frequency.

        Unfolds an array through the instrument response. Note that plotting 
        data in this fashion can be EXTREMELY misleading and should be done 
        with care. In nDspec we define an unfolded model as:
        unfolded(H) = counts(H)/exposure*sum(rmf*arf),
        where H is a given bounds in energy channels, exposure is the exposure 
        time of the observation, rmf*arf is the instrument response, and the sum 
        is carried out every the energy bins of the response. Users also need to 
        specify whether the input array is in units of counts/s/keV or 
        counts/s/channel; if they do so correctly, the output of this method is 
        in photon density - counts/s/keV/cm^2. Assuming 0 background, this 
        definition of unfolding is identical to Isis, regardless of model 
        choice, and Xspec, as long as the model is a constant in each energy 
        bin. Converting to flux units - ie, energy/s/area, then requires 
        multiplying the output of this method by H^2, identically to the 
        "eeunfold" method in Xspec. 
        Unlike Isis and Xspec, this method also supports unfolding two-d arrays,
        e.g. cross spectra.

        -----------

            In the x-axis it needs to be defined over the instrument energy 
            grid, in the y-axis it can be any size (e.g., over a grid of Fourier
