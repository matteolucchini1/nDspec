    """
    Least-chi squared fitter class for a time averaged spectrum, defined as the  
    count rate as a function of photon channel energy bound. 
    
    Given an instrument response, a count rate spectrum, its error and a 
    model (defined in energy space), this class handles fitting internally 
    using the lmfit library.    
        
    Attributes inherited from SimpleFit:
    ------------------------------------
    model: lmfit.CompositeModel 
        A lmfit CompositeModel object, which contains a wrapper to the model 
        component(s) one wants to fit to the data. 
   
    model_params: lmfit.Parameters 
        A lmfit Parameters object, which contains the parameters for the model 
        components.
   
    likelihood: None
        Work in progress; currently the software defaults to chi squared 
        likelihood
   
    fit_result: lmfit.MinimizeResult
        A lmfit MinimizeResult, which stores the result (including best-fitting 
        parameter values, fit statistics etc) of a fit after it has been run.         
   
    data: np.array(float)
        An array storing the data to be fitted. If the data is complex and/or 
        multi-dimensional, it is flattened to a single dimension in order to be 
        compatible with the LMFit fitter methods.
   
    data_err: np.array(float)
        An array containing the uncertainty on the data to be fitted. It is also 
        stored as a one-dimensional array regardless of the type or dimensionality 
        of the initial data.       

    _data_unmasked, _data_err_unmasked: np.array(float)
        The arrays of every data bin and its error, regardless of which ones are
        ignored or noticed during the fit. Used exclusively to enable book 
        keeping internal to the fitter class.        
    
    Attributes inherited from EnergyDependentFit:
    ---------------------------------------------    
    energs: np.array(float)
        The array of physical photon energies over which the model is computed.

    energ_bounds: np.array(float)
        The array of energy bin widths, for each bin over which the model is 
        computed. Defined as the difference between the uppoer and lower bounds 
        of the energy bins stored in the insrument response provided. 
               
    ebounds: np.array(float)

        channels,  as stored in the instrument response provided. Only contains 
        the channels that are noticed during the fit.

    ewidths: np.array(float) 
        The array of energy channel bin widths for the instrument energy
        channels,  as stored in the instrument response provided. Only contains 
        the channels that are noticed during the fit.
        
    ebounds_mask: np.array(bool)
        The array of instrument energy channels that are either ignored or 
        noticed during the fit. A given channel i is noticed if ebounds_mask[i]
        is True, and ignored if it is false. 
        
    n_chans: int 
        The number of channels that are to be noticed during the fit.
        
    _all_chans: int 
        The total number of channels in the loaded response matrix.

        widths stored in the response, regardless of which ones are ignored or 
        noticed during the fit. Used exclusively to facilitate book-keeping 
        internal to the fitter class.         

    Other attributes:
    -----------------
    response: nDspec.ResponseMatrix
        The instrument response matrix corresponding to the spectrum to be
