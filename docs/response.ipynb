    "We can now visualize the response matrix with the ```plot_response``` method. This creates a 2d plot with either channel or channel bound (in units of keV) on the x axis (using the plot_type flag), incoming photon energy on the y axis, and logarithm of instrument response on the z axis; darker colors correspond to larger instrument response. We can notice three things. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the peak of the response is on a diagonal line, with channel bound (or channel timtes 100 for NICER) roughly equal to incoming energy at least up to 10 keV or so. For example, an incoming 6 keV photon will generally be recorded around channel 600, whose energy bounds are close to 6 keV. In other words we can roughly map channel to photon energy. This is true for most X-ray observatories; in the case of NICER specifically, the ratio is roughly 1 keV to 100 channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the bottom left of the plot where channel bound >> incoming energy is zero, while the top left is not. This means that a) a low energy photon will never be recorded in a high (energy) channel, but b) the opposite can happen. Therefore, while we can map channels to energy, this is only an approximation of how the photons are being recorded by the instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, note how the low energy, bottom part of the plot is darker than the top. This is the effect of the NICER effective area, which peaks at 3 keV or so and drops off significantly afterwards."
